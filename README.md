# Example-Forgetting-Text-Classification

[Code Setup]
- Select GPU if available
- Import the libraries at the top of the notebook
- Load the data file (located in Data folder): compbine the two csv files One-Hot_Encoded_Tags_with_Metadata_Part_1.csv and One-Hot_Encoded_Tags_with_Metadata_Part_2.csv into one csv file called One-Hot_Encoded_Tags_with_Metadata.csv
- Load the dataset: Run the code in section: Data processing
- Load the model in: ClassifierD3() in section Model


[Experiment Results]
